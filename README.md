<h1>My name is DGt1e because DGtle was taken.</h1>
<h3>DGtle is "digital" but shortened.</h3><br>
I like coding video games.<br>
I'm learning Python and C#.<br>
The game engine I code in is Unity.<br>
Right now, I use Github for Minecraft mods I make in MCreator.<br>
I make Minecraft mods in MCreator because I can't code in Java, nevermind Minecraft mods.
